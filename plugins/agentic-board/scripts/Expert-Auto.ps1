.SYNOPSIS
    /board expert `auto` — compose the autonomous brief and launch the auto-expert run.

.DESCRIPTION
    Reads the contract, pulls the issue/epic (its enriched plan), composes the autonomous brief
    (role objective + plan + definition-of-done + the capability map + the irreversible line), and
    launches a dedicated session in an isolated worktree — reusing the existing fleet/-Launch +
    worktree machinery. The user is freed and monitors with `/board work -Sessions -Watch`.

    Pure cores (Format-AutoBrief, Get-BudgetVerdict) behind $env:ABIOS_EXPERTAUTO_DOTSOURCE for
    unit tests; the CLI half reads gh + the contract and drives the launch.

    Autonomy brakes only on the irreversible (Expert-Autonomy): the run reaches "PR ready" and
    stops there for the human to merge.

.PARAMETER Issue
    The issue/epic number to execute.

.PARAMETER ProjectNum
    The board number (for status + monitoring).

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Compose + persist the brief and print the plan without spawning anything.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Expert-Auto.ps1 -Issue 123 -ProjectNum 13

## How you work — total self-use of agentic-board (do NOT improvise your own tooling)
- Research / prior-art -> /knowledge add + /knowledge harvest
- Acquire / verify skills -> /skills bootstrap, /skills audit
- Discover latent work -> /scan
- Record work / findings -> /board issue, /board plan, /board triage
- Report progress / evidence -> /board update, [abios-evidence] comment
- Survive budget / interruption -> /board handoff -Save

## Test-first + evidence
Build test-first. After each verify phase, record a structured [abios-evidence] block (what was
tested, the command, the result) to the PR body, the issue comment, and evidence/<issue>.md.

## Self-heal
An in-scope problem: fix it in the loop and continue. An out-of-scope finding (side bug, debt):
file a sanitized 'discovered' issue on the board and keep going — never block on it.

## STOP before the irreversible (brake — ask the human)
STOP before: $irrList.
Reach "PR ready + review gate green" and STOP there. Do NOT merge, deploy, refresh, publish, or
delete on your own.
